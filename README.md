## Technologies

This website is built using:

## [`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org)

React powers all of the graphical components and is built entirely using hooks and no class components.

Packages used include (but are not limited to):
 - [`Redux`](https://redux.js.org) for global state management
 - [`Redux-Saga`](https://redux-saga.js.org) for handling async actions
 - [`Material-UI`](https://material-ui.com) as a component and JSS styling library
 - [`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com) as a navigational router to make an SPA feel like a traditional website

## [`Firebase`](https://firebase.google.com)

Services used:
 - [`Firebase Hosting`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) hosts of the website
 - [`Firestore`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) handles the data storage

## Additional Projects

Since this website is a showcase of my talents, I decided to create some small projects within the site to display my abilities in React, along with my knowledge of the various web services they utilize.

## `Recipe Browser`

    Integrates with [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)'s API, and allows you to browse all the available recipes they have. It also includes the ability to search for and filter the recipes.
